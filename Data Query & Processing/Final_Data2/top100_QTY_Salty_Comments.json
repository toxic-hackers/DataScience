I am going to join the chorus of people telling you as much. Get the fuck out now. Get. The. Fuck. Out. Staying on board after a payroll miss as an  employee  is a terrible fucking idea. If you stick with the effort after a pay miss or even a cut, you are an  equal  with the founders and you are invited to  all  the investor meetings (whether you want to go is up to you). No fucking exceptions ever. People will take advantage of you, not respect you for being \"a nice guy\", if you work for them on bad terms. I made this fucker of a mistake. It was 2008, after the economy imploded. Unrelatedly, I have PTSD which had started throwing panic attacks at me and, for a period of about 3 months, I was unemployable (or thought I was) until I figured out how to manage the attacks. (Now they are no big deal. Very fucking annoying, but I know what they are and can resolve them in 5-20 minutes at worst.) So I was damaged, but I have this extreme work ethic which leads to a false sense of desperation that impels me sometimes to take horrible jobs just to \"be employed\", and this was one case of that. I had savings, but I needed to feel like I was doing something. So I joined a startup on \"deferred cash\" which is essentially a zero-interest loan to your employer. Don't ever fucking do that. Oh, and my salary (what I would have been paid once we got funding, which by the way never fucking happened) was still a 40% drop from what I had earned at the hedge-fund job before that. Talk about a loser fucking move. If you undersell yourself (false desperation) people will pick you the fuck off. Then I went to Google. I had burned lots of savings and, after egregious drama and a huge financial loss, I was a fucking headcase and I made the mistake of disclosing my problem and I had a sadistic pigfucker of a boss who gaslighted me to see what would happen, and ultimately had a two-day-long hypergraphic episode on a 10k mailing list. I found out later that he had a history of using false performance problems to get people to disclose medical problems and then fucking with people who were sick because he enjoyed watching them break down. I found at least three cases, some paid substantial severances. HR knew about the problem but did nothing because the manager had a reputation for \"delivering\". If I hadn't been coming off a horrible startup, I wouldn't have been nearly as vulnerable and he wouldn't have been able to break me (I'm a normal person with an abnormal past, and 95+ percent of the time I can keep it in the fucking past) and that pigfucker bully would have attacked someone else. Bad startups will ruin your fucking life. No exaggeration. I have a pre-existing aggravator but normal people melt down just as hard. In fact, I think it's worse for them because they're not used to insanity and don't recognize it as such when it hits them, so they actually buy into the insane thoughts they start having when the world goes to hell on them (I don't; I'm a veteran of that shit). You will lose lots of money and credibility. Your career will end up in the toilet. Sometimes people will maliciously damage your reputation and you'll seriously consider hiring a hit man, but you can't because you have no fucking money. Payroll miss == Get the fuck out. Now. No exceptions. Do NOT fuck up your life for these people.

By hiding behind the \"biggest and dumbest asshole\" metaphor, you excuse yourself, and the intolerant people who find it right to kill authors for offending their faith, from the obligation to respect others. Muslims are not the dumbest and obviously can learn to live in societies that don't share religiously intolerant laws. Some of the cartoons were funny. I had a couple good laughs out of them. Would I be offended if they were about Christ (I was raised a Catholic)? No way. Would I be offended if they had been about scientists (I am an almost-Atheist)? Of course not. They are cartoons, meant to be funny and to, sometimes, question beliefs.

We've spent a long time online realizing that in a web environment, it's possible to promote ourselves without spreading the low-level negativity associated with older advertising methods. This is the Internet! Gaining lots of publicity for yourself can be achieved with good, happy,  fun  things! The advantage of giving everybody a voice is that now you don't  have  to contact everybody yourself. You can work on making something so good their friends contact them for you. If you think cold calling is the most effective tool you've got when you're sitting in front of a computer, look just a smidge deeper. I think the point of the blog post was dead-on\u2014if you're out to directly establish relationships with people, then establish them without making it a business. You'll find a way to mention the product to them without it deliberately being a sales pitch.  It was a friken cold call and it worked. You went through the trouble to blog about it.  I don't see how it worked. He blogged about it  without  mentioning the name of the product. When I read this, I don't feel any thoughts about the product he was pitched because I don't know what the product was. If the goal was to get promotion, it failed utterly.  I bet you good money you wont forget the company or its product for the next few years though, and every time you see a similar product you can't help but compare them.  I hear this a lot on Hacker News and related fori: People who think that just because you have a product in your mind, it's good advertising. I heard it a lot in particular with the weird Microsoft ads. Well, in the advertising world, that's bogus. People knowing your name does  not  translate to sales unless they know your name in the right context. Apple's 1984 ad is the one they teach for this reason: People discussed it the say after it aired, asking themselves what Macintosh was, what the ad meant, and so they came to the conclusion collectively that Macintosh was something big and new. It's an ad that made a positive spin. But when I see a weird, messed-up ad that I don't understand, or when somebody goes out of their way to mention their product to me, the name sticks around but there's no positive signifier to it. I'm not willing to buy a product just because I recognize their ad. There's got to be something that convinces me it's maybe worth buying. So in this case, perhaps the guy will remember the product name\u2014though I seriously doubt that. You underestimate our ability to block things out that we don't want to hear. I've received a dozen emails from people that wanted me to advertise them on my blog, and I don't remember a single product name. If he  does  remember it, though, that doesn't necessarily brainwash him. He won't see competing products and say, \"Nope, can't think about this, I have another name in mind.\" Rather, he'll ask logical, uninfluenced questions, like \"Do I need this at all? Why would I get  this  rather than  that ?\" If there's any bias now, I'd say it's negative\u2014\"Well,  this  guy didn't think a good promotion would be cold calling. Looks like he's not so much a desperate fucker.\" (That would be my reaction, though to be fair I'm a mean person so it might be a bit over-the-top.) When business people look at everything as a potential sale, they risk wasting a lot of time making a few sales. That's a bad way to do business. Much smarter to figure out how to do the most with a little effort\u2014and friending somebody on Facebook is usually just a bit too much effort to close a sale, especially if you need a thousand sales a month to break even.","comment_id":892314,"parent_id":892124}]},{"commentor":"aaron695","rank_lt_qty_sc":98.0,"cnt_slt_s":142.0,"top_salty_comment":[{"commentor":"aaron695","comment_time":1527117311,"comment_saltiness":-2.0679442128,"is_salty":true,"is_severe_toxicity":false,"is_obscene":true,"is_identity_attack":false,"is_insult":true,"is_threat":false,"parent_type":"story","parent_author":17139351,"parent_title":"US Employee in China Suffers Brain Injury in Case Recalling Cuba Sound 'Attack'","cleaned_comment":"How fucking fucking stupid do you have to be to not know this is Mass Hysteria?
