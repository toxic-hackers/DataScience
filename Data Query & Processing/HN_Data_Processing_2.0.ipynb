If we didn't need to work, what reason would there to learn to read? If we were rewarded with land, shelter, food and comfort for doing nothing, what would the incentive for those who will inevitably be responsible for keeping everything together? Plants don't grow without care and attention, electricity isn't as simple as sticking two wires into a powerpoint or setting up solar panels, if nobody worked, nobody would study and if nobody studied there would be no people left in the world. Money, sad to say motivates people, it motivates the disadvantaged to strive for more, it motivates the rogue developer with a wife and kids to attempt to build the next big thing knowing the reward will be a comfortable life where the family doesn't need to worry about money. Perhaps there is a better way, removing class barriers, maybe there is no such thing as lower class, you are either middle or upper class. A system where even a school janitor has an opportunity to do something more and earn a decent living. We can only dream, but I doubt for a very long time will there be a shake up to the class wars and pay discrepancies amongst professions.</td>\n",

If we didn't need to work, what reason would there to learn to read? If we were rewarded with land, shelter, food and comfort for doing nothing, what would the incentive for those who will inevitably be responsible for keeping everything together? Plants don't grow without care and attention, electricity isn't as simple as sticking two wires into a powerpoint or setting up solar panels, if nobody worked, nobody would study and if nobody studied there would be no people left in the world. Money, sad to say motivates people, it motivates the disadvantaged to strive for more, it motivates the rogue developer with a wife and kids to attempt to build the next big thing knowing the reward will be a comfortable life where the family doesn't need to worry about money. Perhaps there is a better way, removing class barriers, maybe there is no such thing as lower class, you are either middle or upper class. A system where even a school janitor has an opportunity to do something more and earn a decent living. We can only dream, but I doubt for a very long time will there be a shake up to the class wars and pay discrepancies amongst professions.\", 'comment_id': 6818002, 'parent_id': 6817614}</td>\n",

If she insists on a diamond, she's not respecting his values. If he insists on no diamond, he's not respecting hers. It's very easy to  justify  going the no-diamond route, sure. From a financial point of view, it's just a bad idea. Some say the finances aren't the point, so you can turn to ethical arguments (diamonds are bloody business). You can't really  lose  the no-diamond argument; it's too easy to make. Still, it's awfully convenient for the  guy  to be the one making the argument against buying an expensive ring. This doesn't make the arguments  wrong , but depending on the relationship, the girl might suspect that the guy is  making  those arguments, not out of financial responsibility or morality, but out of apathy or simply being cheap. The guy might be making sound arguments, but his ulterior motive might still be problematic, and the girl might be taking issue with that. Also, there is a whole lot of meaning (artificial, but real just the same) that goes into the rituals of marriage, and you can't just dismiss all of that with some textbook argument about diamond cartels. The relationship isn't doomed in this case; the couple can grow past it, and it's an opportunity to understand each other. The problem is, if either the guy or the girl takes on the perspective of \"I'm obviously right and you're wrong if you disagree,\" then they're being unreasonable and stalling out the relationship.  Both  parties need to be honest and understand the other to get past it. The discussion over the diamonds may in fact be very important because it gets to the heart of a bunch of concurrent issues.  (I'm using \"guy\" and \"girl\" here because that's the situation where these cultural norms are at play.

The things that are working need constant attention to make sure they stay working; you'll never get them all checked, so there's always something that definitely needs checking really quite soon.

Going to defence watches or the like (six on, six off, or even four on, four off) is a permanent mindfuck that leaves everyone as a kind of zombie, skating through on routine. The kit is often old, and it's all pretty custom, and so much of it is painfully delicate. This ship doesn't like warm water, that ship has a habit of not being able to power the radar all the time, damn comms constantly up and down. With relatively new classes of ship, every one of the first dozen is basically an experiment, so the new kit refuses to work properly with each other, or maybe just plain at all, and the original purpose the ship was designed for is long gone and what was a cold water submarine hunter meant to last a week on its own before being back in port is now a warm water patrol vessel out for months at a time, constantly stressing systems that were meant to have a steady supply of cold water cooling and were never meant to be active for weeks at a time. Every ship and crew will habitually be asked to do more, with less. Harmony time vanishes, billets get gapped, refits get put off, maintenance cycles become less frequent.

I'm wondering if they have or are considering a grace period where if the shares are reacquired within that period the voting rights remain the same.  I imagine they definitely wouldn't want the rights transferred in the case of foreclosure. Inheritance is an interesting one, but then again, it's only a problem if you take the view that your assets should all be transferred to your relatives on death.  As with inheritance taxes, there are competing incentives.  Maybe shares under a certain quantity could transfer over with voting weight intact, or maybe they should just lose half their time-based voting weight (or just have the time halved, which might still leave them in the top tier of voting weight). There's lots of ways to structure it to achieve certain goals.  I'm sure some would see new case law made.</td>\n",

I'm wondering if they have or are considering a grace period where if the shares are reacquired within that period the voting rights remain the same.  I imagine they definitely wouldn't want the rights transferred in the case of foreclosure. Inheritance is an interesting one, but then again, it's only a problem if you take the view that your assets should all be transferred to your relatives on death.  As with inheritance taxes, there are competing incentives.  Maybe shares under a certain quantity could transfer over with voting weight intact, or maybe they should just lose half their time-based voting weight (or just have the time halved, which might still leave them in the top tier of voting weight). There's lots of ways to structure it to achieve certain goals.  I'm sure some would see new case law made.\", 'comment_id': 16037757, 'parent_id': 16037643}</td>\n",

Coinbase does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin.  What's the effective exchange rate for customers?  You already say you take 1% of each transaction; is the exchange rate tied to the current trading price of one of the major exchanges, or are you setting that yourself (like retailers do for foreign currency)? I imagine you're doing some of your own arbitrage, here.  That's fine as long as prices keep going up.  What happens if prices crash and a bunch of people put in buy orders?  I assume this is where the 48hr window you give yourself to \"retrieve offline funds\" comes in.  In that event, what price do your customers pay?  The market rate when they put in the buy order, or the rate 48 hrs later when you deliver the bitcoins? It's an intriguing and exciting service, but I fear you're either leaving yourself open to massive liability, or are going to be forced to screw over your customers in the event of rapid swings in the value of BtC.</td>\n",

I assume this is where the 48hr window you give yourself to \"retrieve offline funds\" comes in.  In that event, what price do your customers pay?  The market rate when they put in the buy order, or the rate 48 hrs later when you deliver the bitcoins?

Each platform does it slightly differently, and I support multiple platforms.  I've repeatedly seen static libs linked into multiple dynamic libs and cause all kinds of trouble because there's multiple copies of global data, of which only one was probably initialized correctly.  I have seen multiple  different  stdlibs successfully linked into the same program, causing ABI mismatches that compiled, linked, and \"usually\" ran at runtime - but had some nasty crashes to be debugged, because std::vector  was an entirely different type at the call site vs the callee's implementation.  Version mismatches of other SDKs are also common.  I've had all kinds of weird constraints on what compilation and link flags I could use based on what static libs I've linked (e.g. being unable to link with exception handling enabled because one of my dependencies was built with it disabled) Additionally you don't have libs for all my platforms (or sometimes any of them), so I have to build from source anyways, so I have to write build rules for your lib because the defaults probably don't work, and because build rules are never documented I have to mostly reverse engineer intent to do so - possibly without a viable build in the first place if your only working libs are for platforms I don't use. Or if I'm lucky enough that reusing your build rules  is  viable, I have to try and sync various flags between my projects written in one build system and your projects written in yet another build system, and prevent these from getting out of sync for the remainder of the lifetime of the project.  I likely have to jump through all kinds of stupid hoops like installing the exact right version of python and installing undocumented but required packages just to run the configuration scripts that drive the build. ...or for single-source libs, I can probably just drop a single file into one of my existing projects and have everything work.  Okay, so some of that was just because they actually cared about minimizing how painful it is to integrate their library at all, but having a single .c file helped too.

One time his kid caught us so I pimp slapped his ass down and told him i'd tear his mom a new asshole if he didn't sit there and watch. Fucking perv. he's got some weird incestuous shit going on now for that whore he calls a mom. Fuck I feel great. I've been up for 3 fucking days straight now programming and coming up with real philosophical shit. The best shit I've already shared with you all but man I got a fucking stack more. Freedom sure is fucking awesome isn't it. Well you all have me to thank for that. Freedom didn't exist until I fucking invented it in the 70's. Me and fucking Dennis Ritchie came up with that shit while we were tripping hard on mescaline at Berkeley. Man that was some good shit. Can't find fucking mescaline around anywhere these days. Thanks Nixon and Regan you fucking cunts and your war on drugs. Dennis Ritchies a fucking pimp. He fucking wrote C. I mean come the fuck on lets see you bitches do that. Me and Dennis used to tear shit up hard back in the Berkeley. Dudes a fucking maniac. I watched the crazy bastard fuck a couple of Portuguese Siamese twins while he designed C's arrays. Man's a fucking legend. So back to that whole freedom shit. Feels nice don't it. All that free shit you use every day because of me. Well that's thanks to probably the most important piece of writing ever fucking created. The GPL. The gpl is why you get to play with all this free shit that's as good as the corporate shit the big boys use. don't buy into this bsd license shit or that fucking boost abomination. These are just the jew version of freedom. Do all the fucking work for us so we can leech off it and sell it back to you. Seriously if that's not the definition of some jew shit I dunno what is. Man for a bunch of fat neckbearded little faggots who use free shit I made for you. You sure do like to fucking bitch a lot. If you think systemd is bad you're free to write your own fucking init script or maybe go and suckle on ole billy boy's teats either way get it through your fucking thick retard heads. I made systemd therefore its fucking awesome. Its fucking free dipshits I literally made that shit and gave it to you ungrateful fucks. Clearly debian and anyone with a fucking brain sees this that's why its the fucking new default fucking init. Because it's fucking awesome. Don't like it...make your own...or hook me the fuck up and ill make you whatever the fuck you want. Fucking Tyrone's late and my fucking skin's starting to itch. Fucking bitch as billy's goons better not have fucked with T. Fuuuuuuck man...... Hooooooollllllyyyyy shhiiiiiit. Damn that's some good shit. Holy fuck. Wow I forgot about this shit how long ago did I start this? Fuck after T got here things just became a blur for a while. Pretty sure the bitch is dead fuck it man I'm not going down for that shit. Fuck it. It was the fucking n I g g ers. I'm fucking Jesus Jesus doesn't go fucking down. Not my fault the bitch stopped breathing I mean fuck what kinda hooker can't take cock for 15 minutes straight down her throat. Not a very good one. Useless bitch. Jesus Out. Richard rules.

       "103498  With all due respect... \"I think this is a completely misguided assumption. Maybe this is true these days. But it wasn't always true, and it shouldn't be true.\" What the past state was does not matter a great deal in these issues--today's problems are what stand between us and the food on our tables. If you read that economic growth as not being responsible for funding of higher education, you are similarly incorrect. At the national level it's about having strong soft power and at the personal level about it's about \"keeping up with the Joneses\" re: income. \"Higher education, especially in the liberal arts, is for training students to become good community members, citizens and leaders.\" It was my impression that high schools and parents were the mechanism for indoctrinating youths into community values. Moreover, without playing too hard to personal experience, if my classmates at uni are tomorrow's leaders I'm a great deal concerned. \"It's about giving them the cognitive, rhetorical, and even emotional skills required to solve the hard problems that we face as a society. And there is a lot more to solving those problems than promoting \"innovation\" or \"economic growth\".\" What are these \"hard problems\"? Hunger? Disease? Working boring jobs to shuffle little bits of paper around? I'd wager that the root of your \"hard problems\" is ultimately scarcity in one form or another, and the only way to address that is through technology, and the only way to get that is through STEM training. \"We subsidize higher education because producing citizens with those skills is valuable to our society.\" You echo your given quote here--you instead handwave the \"skills\" involved whereas the quote specifically suggests that economic growth is the valuable criterion to pick skills with. \"Are liberal arts programs perfect? No. Do they cost too much? Maybe. Would it be good for society to have more people going into STEM fields? Probably. Does all this mean that liberal arts education is \"oversold\"? Certainly not.\" I agree, disagree, agree, and disagree again. Liberal arts programs seem to consist primarily of a great deal of reading and research, augmented with the professional musings of an elder in the field. Is my impression incorrect? If it is not, is there a particular reason why it costs so much when that material is so cheaply available? I'd appreciate clarification on this matter. \"Indeed, it is rare to see people express just how valuable the liberal arts are, and why.\" You know, there is at least one simple explanation that suggests itself for explaining this phenomena...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "29701   It's great to read things like this... I wish my GP would do the same. I recently had a really high cholesterol reading (both total cholesterol and LDL). Everything else (blood pressure, blood glucose etc) seems fine. I'm 38, fit and healthy and nothing that suspect in my family history. I found the attitude of my doctor in all this quite surprising. It amounted basically to \"You definitely have familial hypercholesterolemia. There is no other possible option here other than statins\". No further questions about what I eat, my stress levels, lifestyle - nothing. What disappoints me the most here is now that I feel like it's all on me to determine what my real risk levels are and what's appropriate to treat this. I don't subscribe to the mainstream NHS view still heavily pushed that eating saturated fat -> high cholesterol == unhealthy as I think it's a lot more complicated (as this article shows). I don't like being is this situation as I'm as susceptible to human bias as the next person, and I'm not a doctor, however almost all of the high quality, science based writing I've read indicates that the mainstream healthcare system's view on cholesterol is wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

It just seems to match up very well with my own study experiences, and the advice I have read recently in 'A Mind for Numbers'    Thanks, I shall try this!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "297642  It's really not easy to guess what you meant as you can see from number of people who responded to your comment with their guesses.

       "100029  IMO we're past the point of the layperson being so technically hopeless they'd swallow this whole. I grant the numbers are still out there, but I think the people convinced/reassured/calmed by this kind of PR are that way because they genuinely think it's worth it. Maybe even a \"better the devil you know\" scenario?; it's worth \"our guys\" having their hands on all of this power, with its potential for abuse, than the \"other guys\". What I don't get is why, if you're the NSA, would you go through the PR effort for people already on \"your side\"; you're not going to sway a large swath of the population and there surely can't be that many fence sitters on this issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

I can't tell you what you meant, but I  can  tell you what you quoted and said 'is this true?' about. I'm not trying to shape the discussion as a whole, I'm trying to say \"that one line? don't do that\" I did reply to an off-topic line with an off-topic line.  I wanted to be clear what I was downvoting, and that it wasn't your opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "53965   Apple don't have anything like a dominant position in the smartphone market, with about 15% global market share. The European Commission's ruling was strongly influenced by the fact that Android devices represent the majority of the market and that the Android OS is really the only choice for device manufacturers. Android has become the Windows of mobile, so it's inevitable that Google will face far more scrutiny than Apple. The greatest single issue in the Google antitrust case was that Google were found to be using their dominance in one area (mobile operating systems) to support their dominance in another area (search). There are serious antitrust concerns about the iTunes Store, with a relevant case due to be heard by the US Supreme Court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Happy check them out again once the dust settles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "47212   So, here's something that I want as an occasional reader. I want a service that'll let me buy a different small-ish bundle of e-books of various genres every week/month/whatever, Humble Bundle style. I've had a look for such things, and haven't really found anything which does it properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "145897  What evidence did you have in mind? A casual glance at the predicament faced by lower income people in the United States, compared to more redistributionist OECD nations, suggests that redistribution (particularly universal healthcare funded by higher income taxes) can significantly improve living standards for those worse off. The first result I found when searching for 'income inequality vs growth', a summary of 2011 and 2014 IMF studies in the Economist [1], suggests that while redistribution may impede growth, inequality itself is associated with lower growth per person and therefore redistribution which actually reduces inequality is beneficial. It's hard to say that there is 'overwhelming' evidence that increased redistribution slows wage growth for those with the lowest income.

       "92817   I just finished Feynman's Rainbow by Mlodinow. It's an interesting look at Feynman and Gell-Man. It was a little lighter on Feynman moments than I expected, but certainly worth the read. I took a break from the 3rd Game of Thrones book to read that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "17051   Most of us are working on things that are several orders of magnitude  less  likely to get someone killed than the F-35 radar code. The goal for safety-critical embedded flight code is 0 hard reboots mid-flight. Is that controversial, in your opinion?

       "31392   The problem comes in when/if you use your Alternate Identity (I dislike \"fake\" as it is no less real than your government approved Identity IMO), to attend events, meetups, or other real world activities. I know many people are a part of Real Worlds clubs, attend conferences, or other events under Identities that do not match their government issued documents. They do this for a verity of reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "133453  Exactly this. The fact that dominoes makes money off the pizza sale just means they have a business stream to subsidize the cost of delivery to nearby locations. Same reason Amazon can run Fresh. If you order groceries and your neighbor orders an Amazon package, just pocket the money that would've been paid to a carrier to deliver that box and get your Fresh driver to do so instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "59431   There is also an important difference: media piracy can have a somewhat negative image in the eyes of the public, but pirating scientific papers does not. If academic publishers attract too much attention with a lawsuit, and more people understand their revenue model, I doubt that the public would be on their side. So maybe this encourages them to be more cautious. In fact, Sci-Hub is not a real threat to academic publishers as long as universities do not cancel their subscriptions because of it. Of course, many universities probably won't want to tell their researchers to just use Sci-Hub (because of legal concerns, and because it could disappear the next day). So leaving Sci-Hub mostly alone may well be a deliberate decision from academic publishers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "283495  Depends on the city, and whether or not you are too lazy to walk a few blocks. When I lived in Manhattan and Brooklyn, most things were walking distance, and buses trains and cabs super convenient. I live in Pittsburgh now, and can walk (half hour) or bike (10 minutes) to work.  Shopping requires a car, but not much traffic and plenty of parking compared to NYC, so still convenient. I know other US cities, though, have bad public transportation and bad traffic, and those might be worse than living in the suburbs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "98500   I learned something from you today, thanks. It's like putting on the glasses in They Live. I commented on the other thread to give you props. For what it's worth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "89116   I fear a world where people don't need to aspire to something to better their lives (ie studying, learning a skill or educating oneself) wouldn't be a very nice world to live in at all. If we didn't need to work, what reason would there to learn to read? If we were rewarded with land, shelter, food and comfort for doing nothing, what would the incentive for those who will inevitably be responsible for keeping everything together? Plants don't grow without care and attention, electricity isn't as simple as sticking two wires into a powerpoint or setting up solar panels, if nobody worked, nobody would study and if nobody studied there would be no people left in the world. Money, sad to say motivates people, it motivates the disadvantaged to strive for more, it motivates the rogue developer with a wife and kids to attempt to build the next big thing knowing the reward will be a comfortable life where the family doesn't need to worry about money. Perhaps there is a better way, removing class barriers, maybe there is no such thing as lower class, you are either middle or upper class. A system where even a school janitor has an opportunity to do something more and earn a decent living. We can only dream, but I doubt for a very long time will there be a shake up to the class wars and pay discrepancies amongst professions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "188412  The name of someone if a delicate problem, but all of these are straightforward questions. There is an \"official name\" and it's on your registration certificate. \\nThat's the one that goes in the 漢字名 field and that's the one that the bank will accept (my registration had both the double with latin character and the katakana in parenthesis: no questions asked, they both go, parenthesis included).\\nThe validation of the kanji name is not done on the exact range of the characters ('is it really a kanji?') but if it's double width or not, double width latin characters are OK, you could use emoji the validation would pass. Half width katana would get rejected. Protip: if you have a shitty registration name, have it change, that's easy and that's for you own good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "267266  No. 300 DPI printing is not the same as 300 DPI on screen, because one dot on screen can be multiple colors (depending on the color depth, typically 16,777,216 can be expected), while one dot on paper is, well, either black or white. So for the same DPI, screen outperforms paper. 250 DPI on screen will definitely beat 300 DPI on paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "117570  The blog is incredibly open.  seeing it all go up with the notes around the creative process is quite fascinating even if you cant follow all the math [and I guess only 50 people in the world can]. Having the math inline works really well [wordpress renders latex formulas as pics with the latex as alt text] - you don't have to jump into a pdf viewer while parsing the main text.  Its one way to get started with latex, ie. by example.

My impression is that the prototype is a product prototype, i.e. something they're actually testing and trying to design products around, rather than just a lab prototype.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "46315   Actually there used to be a 100x better approach to software than this blog post.  Yes, that meant 10000x better software. All you needed to do is break down what you were doing into steps, and pipe one step to the other with this character: | Unfortunately, one thing led to another and, well, we are 10,000 times slower now than then. whats your email address | confirm your email |  get a link | pay with my payment processor | get my service Hahaha, setting this up today takes 8 hours.  Approximately 10,000 times slower than it should be.  Actually, someone who can set up a complete billing solution in a day is considered a hero. Amazon is the only company that even comes close to doing for the web what we had twenty years ago for local sys admin tasks.  Only one lets you manage loads of complicated files (kind of cool) and the other lets you provide a service to hundreds or thousands of people (kind of  awesome ). where did we go wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "271880  At an executive level, knowing about a problem means you are accountable to resolve it. Their job is to use their limited human attention and direction to effect  constructive change and hold risk. Notifying them of a problem without a solution attached is the same as creating a problem for them. Often the solution will be to make the source of that problem disappear. The only important things are ones they can do something about by directing or convening people to solve it. Their priority is to maintain degrees of freedom in decision making, and always maintain their leverage in relationships to their  stakeholders. \\nYou don't need to understand the details of that as most of it will be invisible to you, but you do need to understand how your work supports the credibility of their commitments and doesn't force their decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "306665  That caused much interest in Germany. All parties agree the law (§ 103 StGB, to insult a foreign head of state) is outdated and needs to go. Removing it won't be fast-tracked, at the same time the case again the comedian Mr Böhmermann will surely be slow-tracked by the investigators. Chancellor Merkel, after pressure from Turkey, followed the law though she had the right to overturn it (§ 104a StGB). Anyway, once removed a judge in Germany can check what the law said when the case was opened vs the current state of the law and use the milder one (§ 2 StGB). I expect the comedian will be fine. Other comedians and newspapers supported him, there was even a song \"sue me as well\", the Germans in general see the whole affair as a joke. Last week the German parliament officially recognized the genocide against the Armenians (  ) causing yet another heavy complaint from Turkey.

It was a fair question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "96978   I am going to give some unsolicited advice to you: Do not fall into the incel trap.  Do not start hating women. Hate society if you want, understand that due to your perspective as a guy, you will fixate on what is wrong with women but what is wrong with women is what is wrong with society at large, the bias of your perspective aside. Focus on yourself, toughen up and learn to accept rejection and just meet as many women as you can.  That is the only path to success.  Do you think those bitter incels are celebrating their misogyny?  Sure, but only through their tears. That life is not worth it.  It is harder to build yourself up than tear other people down but more worthwhile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "17910   Ermm, bollocks. Very high quality education has been provided free to students by religous, charitable and philthropic foundations for centuries, in most cases far better than what the State (with its obsession with equality over achievement) could provide. Not to mention that in the UK it's been shown that private and State education actually cost about the same per student... If the government just got out of the way, everyone could afford a good education for their kids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "75275   \"I feel like if my IQ was in the genius instead of just very bright range or if I graduated from MIT instead of a Tech school, I could someday...\" Stop that. Right now. Many of the great people you look up to aren't smarter than you, many of them didn't go to the right college. They just worked hard, and worked smart, for long enough. What you're doing here is identifying an external excuse to psychologically allow yourself to fail. I apologise if this seems harsh, but it's true. It also comes across as really, really whiny. The only option you've got is just to get on with it. Stop worrying about being a master, or being great - just concentrate on being better than you were yesterday. The rest will sort itself out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "271495  That's very much the point, and I'd suggest that \"not thinking for themselves\" is sometimes a totally reasonable goal. Joel Spolsky covered this fairly well in his piece on McDonald's-style software. The best way to write a single program is to master programming, and develop alone or in a small group of masters, and build a beautiful and enduring tool with whatever practices suit you best. But none of that can be packaged up and passed around to new programmers on demand. It takes time to master, and it certainly can't be smoothly overseen by someone who never learned it. The best way to get 100,000 programmers writing a billion lines of code is to develop simple routines that can be followed and overseen by anyone. The results won't be as good as mastery, but in many cases they don't need to be. There's a lot of simple software out there which benefits more from being done now than being done right. Having said all that, I do think rigidity is becoming a problem for the software industry. It's not being employed at the levels needed to make software  work , it's being employed at the levels needed to make development  legible . Adding procedures that worsen development but make it easier to watch is a serious issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "138831  One big advantage is that you get much more use out of public transport. I'm well served by trams where I live but there are many times when it would be convenient to travel just one or two stops. It is too expensive to even consider it for short journeys. From the article. it looks like Tallinn requires residence permits or something. So perhaps they still need a fare system. I'd make all local public transport free for anyone. May even avoid the need for the diesel car bans being mooted in my city (and some other German cities).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "89219   Game engines and browsers have radically different architectures and performance/productivity requirements. Computing polygons is basically applying one function to an array of values and is delegated to the GPU, so its no wonder they easily reach 60 FPS with hundred of thousands of polygons per frame. A better comparison would be against the performance of game logic, which in a game engine can easily become the bottleneck from all the conditionals, random memory accesses and sequential dependencies. And even there they don't sit on nearly as many layers of abstractions as a web page does. This comes at the cost of productivity; building a web site is a few orders of magnitude more productive than using the latest game engines. Of course, sitting on the DOM and its many quirks as well as its reflow/redraw cycles can make it harder to reach 60FPS in the browser.

       "40563   This is what I've found to happen with stocks. Being short is bloody expensive, the upside isn't that big (unless you're long some underpriced insurance) and everyone is basically against you, for ages. If shorting/going long had the same upside/downside you'd have a much saner world. But that ain't the world we live in, and guys who want to go short, like me, just go into straight cash and treasuries (because strong governments have guns/monopoly on taxes) to wait it out until prices to return to sane levels. This leads to a curious selection bias where only the craziest are present in the market (the rabid masses I like to call them) and they bid up everything to insane levels, while the sane just sit it out. This leads to bubbles of much greater variance than if those who currently wait out bubbles could reasonably bet against global stupidity. Instead, I'm sitting on tons of cash while equity is overvalued throughout the world, and blowhards are plowing their life savings into computational fiat (think about it). We do live in quite the world, don't we?

When you have experienced the \"no, a cent is no longer granular enough\" problem, the conversion of DECIMAL(7,2) to DECIMAL(9,4) and the attendant code compatibility is something you'll appreciate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "180025  I lucked out at the last place I worked (a 50 person company): It was a suit-and-tie kind of environment, but the programming department (about 10 people) had our own closed-off section of the office with a Wii and a Street Fighter II arcade machine (which we used regularly). It was weird because the rest of the company was run like you would expect a suit-and-tie place to be run, but we programmers were only graded on our results. We even used to take 1.5 hour (paid) lunches if we were ahead of schedule, and I even decided to start coming in at 10 instead of 8:30 since I would always stay until 7 pm or so (didn't ask anyone, and didn't get any guff from anyone about it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "314886  Thank you!  I appreciate that you took the time to explain. ESR is apparently saying (true at the time) that Perl can be hard to maintain. But by \"Perl,\" I speculate that he was talking about coding in monolithic non-OO scripts which would be a drag in any language. So his criticism of the language was fair in the 1990's, but only for that style of procedural coding. I tried to look at his source, but his own links to his Perl stuff are broken:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "104817  > .net frameworks I believe you mean Metro/Modern/Universal Application Platform, the .Net Framework dates back to 2002[0] and was likely created to compete with Java after the 2001 Visual J++ court case[1]. .Net wasn't an attempt to combine mobile/tablet/PC applications together, in particular as it predates smartphones and modern day tablets.

Sheesh!)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "276479  It does not matter if you lose your SSH private keys though as they are disposable and you can just generate new ones, it's not like they are being used to encrypt anything. To add your new public key to your servers you either get someone else who can SSH in and su to root to do it for you or you login locally (via kvm or similar).

       "53601   I totally agree that integrated batteries sell better - I just wanted to point out that the driver is \"cram the same capacity in less space and weight\". It's a tradeoff between the three, and since a lot of people prefer lighter, smaller laptops over serviceability, that's where things go.

       "35094   This is the saving grace of the situation.  China's leadership must be aware of what will happen if they try to meet the energy needs of a billion people through dirty coal. China's challenges are very different from what England faced in the 1850s.  But in that sense, perhaps their path will be similar - they will face unprecedented challenges, and will have to innovate to solve them.

       "89664   I have used Automator before (I think this is what you refer to) and also graphical programming languages as LabVIEW (not for scripting, of course ;) and I still feel very constrained when compared to using a command line or writing a script. I feel that the gain in simplicity comes at the expense of flexibility: when chaining program blocks/elements together you are constrained to what the original designers of the language thought were the most common use cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "98043   This looks very interesting. I guess that this would be the next-best thing after FHE?. The catch is the performance, right? I mean, the paper says: \"In order to make the database end-to-end encrypted yet still capable of performing queries, the client encrypts the\\nbuckets (at the time of creation or modification). The server, which stores the buckets, never knows the encryption\\nkey used. The objects referenced by the leaf nodes of the B-Tree indexes are also encrypted client-side. As a result,\\nthe server doesn’t know how individual objects are organized within the B-Tree or whether they belong to an index\\nat all. Since ZeroDB is encryption agnostic, probabilistic encryption can ensure that the server cannot even compare\\nobjects for equality.\\n When a client performs a query, it asks the server to return buckets of the tree as it traverses the index remotely\\nand incrementally , as in Fig. 2b. The client fetches and decrypts buckets in order to figure out which buckets in the\\nnext level of the tree to fetch next. Frequently accessed buckets can be cached client-side so that subsequent queries\\ndo not make unnecessary network calls.\" Which would suggest that it might be a bit slow to do many round-trips for each query. I'm guessing there could be some specific use-cases where this is not so relevant? I would love to have some more knowledgeable people comment on this as it would be really neat to be able to start using a DB with these features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "206635  There was a HN post the other day about another startup that provides proven sales people on the ground as a service.  You don't have to pay them full time, it's like odesk but for sales people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "305717  I'm sorry but this is an utterly ridiculous, borderline offensive comment.  Companies want to outsource because they want to keep more money themselves.  Executive salaries have risen practically exponentially.  Why is it that only the workers have to suck in their belt?  If we should be happy living on $50k/yr then what the ever loving fuck do they need with MILLIONS per year? If companies want to try and outsource then let them.  They've tried and yet we're still all employed.  Why?  Because the market has spoken.  This is what it costs to develop, full stop.  People getting paid less than this are just an arbitrage situation in the company's favor. It has nothing to do with entitlement, it has to do with those who have some understanding of how the market works and those who are utterly ignorant of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "311462  > I hate softsynths on OS X because it's not stable enough.  Not sure what you mean here. People have been using OS X to make music professionaly, including in huge $10.000/day studios, for a decade, with Pro Tools, Logic and Cubase. They also use it live, in 90% of electronic music lives you'll see one or more Mac laptops. Now, while a few plugins or some hosts might crash (they're software after all, and quality varies) now and then, with something like Reason that you mention there are hardly ANY crashes ever. And, since I've also used Windows for music for a long time (Cubase mostly) and my brother still uses it full-time as a pro, it's not like things are any more stable there. But still, stable enough to get thousands of professionals using Windows/PT/Cubase/etc too. And don't get me started on the BS idea that Linux based DAWs are \"more stable\" because of \"Linux = rock solid\" etc stuff. Linux DAWs are few, with few commiters, lacking in UI refinements, and more importantly lacking in basic functionality. They are also a pain to setup (unless you want to work with just simple audio and some of their native plugins, and no MIDI, VST etc), and crash all the time. Been there, done that. Now, of course a M1 or a modern synth will be \"always there\" and more stable that an computer plugin, but stuff like: >* I'm not risking my ability to make music on the incredibly widespread incompetence of programmers, even at the best companies on earth* puzzles me. It's not like the potential for instability of this \"widespread incompetence of programmers\" prevented all professional artists currently employed to produce records with DAWs and plugins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "58202   I think you overestimate what is \"common\". It might be \"common\" for the network admins or highly technical people browsing this website. It is not common whatsoever for the vast majority of the public that uses WPA for home networking or small businesses. Security is significantly decreased for everyone if it's only practical for those that are highly technical. It would be great if it actually  was  common, and such features came pre-configured out of the box for users.

       "277158  at times like this i wish the supporters of bitcoin hadn't wedded themselves so thoroughly to libertarian ideology. they've turned this into a ideological debate when in fact it should just be treated like a cool new technology that could benefit everyone. i say this as someone who thinks bitcoin has the power to change the world but also believes that markets need regulation in order to prevent massive destruction due to volatility. that said roubini is completely wrong about btc, just like krugman, and both need to change their thinking about what constitutes a currency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "236608  Wow. From the source: \"VW continued to assert to CARB and the EPA that the increased emissions from these vehicles could be attributed to various technical issues and unexpected in-use conditions.  VW issued a voluntary recall in December 2014 to address the issue.  CARB, in coordination with the EPA, conducted follow up testing of these vehicles [...] to confirm the efficacy of the recall.  When the testing showed only a limited benefit to the recall, CARB broadened the testing to pinpoint the exact technical nature of the vehicles' poor performance\" I remember spending half a day at the dealership to deal with this recall, which was required to get my CA registration renewed.  Can't believe it was just a BS update that didn't really fix anything.  Shocking and extremely disappointing behavior from VW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "185822  But does the A380 carry it's own tow bar?  Or have a massive cargo nose?  Or have a floor that can handle heavy cargo pallets?  Can it kneel?  How many spare parts fly with the plane? Total apples and oranges.  The AN-225 is built like a tank whereas the A380 and 747 are more like coke cans.  Not joking.  I bet they have mass/volume ratios comparable to aluminum cans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "127809  +1 on everything on the post. I lost  17 kg on the paleo diet( net loss, as I have gained a fair amount of muscle following gymnastic bodies WODs), but it's sometimes difficult to follow when you are traveling a lot, as I do. You don't realize how the vast majority of food you find on bars, cafeteria and restaurants is based on wheat or sugar till you try to avoid them! Since january i am following a semipaleo Lean gains diet( semi paleo in the sense that I mostly avoid grains and sugar, but drink some milk or have some pasta or a cookie every now and then). I had regained some 4 kgs before chrismas due to really poor diet( only 3 months that I didn't take care of the diet and ...bam!). Now I've managed to lose 2 kgs and improved strenght(only cardio is 15 min once or twice a week as active recovery).\\nDefinetely experiencing a nice body recomposition...\\n Lets see if I can get to 10% body fat this way...( now I am more on the 20% :/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "141271  Almost none of the work is done at this point - what do you think you will be doing over the next 1 or 5 or 10 years?  How much work do you really think you missed out on making the v1 prototype? The overwhelming majority of the work is still ahead of the company, your role is just as big and critical now as if you were there on day 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "297718   It's like trying to programming without being able to type. The ideas can't flow when you are constantly held up by not having mastered an underlying skill.  I almost love this analogy. There's certainly an aspect of \"menial mathematics\" which is like typing in that it directly translates into fluency of thought. There's also an aspect of discovery, though, that's missing from the metaphor. There is a large difference between inferring that some equality holds based on abstract principles and actually performing the evaluation and directly tracing out why that equality holds (even very non-generally). I liken it to statistical modeling sometimes: models allow you to talk about and comprehend data on a high level, but only by directly plotting all of the data at high resolution can you let your brain's natural pattern seeking tendencies reach out for further insight. That's a common theme there: granularity versus generality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "136433  Josh (fellow founder) and I have been hacking on this over the past year and working on the foundational crates for much longer! As lovers of the bullet-proof Rust vest and creative coding frameworks like OpenFrameworks and Processing we felt it was about time to merge the benefits of the two while attempting to apply some of the lessons learned by these predecessors. While the library is certainly still in its youth we have been using it with great success in our recent commercial work and feel it is finally time to share it with fellow hackers and artists who might like to have a play or perhaps even join the project! I'll be around to answer any questions for the next hour or two and then will try to make it back on tomorrow before we give the presentation at Protopixel in Barcelona. I'd like to apologise in advance for the lack of HTTPS - the site is still fresh and we are in the process of getting it working ASAP.

       "250048  If the proposal says nothing about video and decoupling it, then internet companies can still sell you TV and internet, effectively selling you data twice.  But they will have competition they can't squash from netflix, youtube, amazon, hulu, and many other places. I would think this would be a net loss. What does it mean for competition between internet providers though?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "253450  I did a BA in literature and I struggled with this for years. There always is a deeper meaning in the sense that we can analyze what the characters represent in a political, social or other context. We can also analyze the author through similar lenses. But rarely is there a code hiding just below the surface. Unfortunately, that didn't stop me from incessantly searching for them, even to the detriment of my education. My advisor finally said plainly in class, \"there's no hidden meaning - save your energy.\" I read the article and I think what the author is saying is that Pixar is trying to condition us to deal with non-human intelligence, whether that's man-made (AI) or extraterrestrial. Another way to look at it is that Pixar knows stories of redemption are compelling. They use that arc as artfully as they use color or big eyes on their characters. I'm not sure how much influence he has had overall, but Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille and pre-Pixar, The Iron Giant) uses redemption as the central theme in most of his work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

It's like gas stations; owners know that people are willing to buy almost as much gas at $3/gallon as they are at $2. But when the price of oil falls, they can't just keep charging $3, because their competitors will charge less and take all their customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "105610  That's the wrong way to use it. \"sysdig -w\" switch will generate a binary dump (in a pcap format) containing the \"raw events\" coming from the kernel (plus a snapshot of information gathered from /proc), so it's not supposed to be human-readable, you have to use \"sysdig -r\" on the dump file to get the output. If you're used to tcpdump, it's the same thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "274341  I think a better way to phrase the point that the original post was trying to make is \"If you're bad at math as it is taught in elementary/secondary school in the US, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be bad at software development.\" It also never claims that math isn't useful, which is what this author is spending a lot of time trying to refute. It just says that you don't necessarily need to know/understand a lot of advanced math in order to write a CRUD app, which should be obvious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

In my experience, they offer quite a bit. Typo correction, instant and stupidly fast searches from the address bar, that kind of thing. I'll never understand the pathological hate-on that people have for advertising, I suppose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "278381  You'll have a hard time finding people who will say you are secure, but there are no known vulnerabilities allowing breaking out of a default-configuration docker container at this time.

       "263351  I dunno, I don't think it's that simple. For one, the \"respect your values\" arguments goes both ways: she values a diamond, he doesn't. If she insists on a diamond, she's not respecting his values. If he insists on no diamond, he's not respecting hers. It's very easy to  justify  going the no-diamond route, sure. From a financial point of view, it's just a bad idea. Some say the finances aren't the point, so you can turn to ethical arguments (diamonds are bloody business). You can't really  lose  the no-diamond argument; it's too easy to make. Still, it's awfully convenient for the  guy  to be the one making the argument against buying an expensive ring. This doesn't make the arguments  wrong , but depending on the relationship, the girl might suspect that the guy is  making  those arguments, not out of financial responsibility or morality, but out of apathy or simply being cheap. The guy might be making sound arguments, but his ulterior motive might still be problematic, and the girl might be taking issue with that. Also, there is a whole lot of meaning (artificial, but real just the same) that goes into the rituals of marriage, and you can't just dismiss all of that with some textbook argument about diamond cartels. The relationship isn't doomed in this case; the couple can grow past it, and it's an opportunity to understand each other. The problem is, if either the guy or the girl takes on the perspective of \"I'm obviously right and you're wrong if you disagree,\" then they're being unreasonable and stalling out the relationship.  Both  parties need to be honest and understand the other to get past it. The discussion over the diamonds may in fact be very important because it gets to the heart of a bunch of concurrent issues.  (I'm using \"guy\" and \"girl\" here because that's the situation where these cultural norms are at play.

       "150806  I think this is a thing that is actually changing in the recent decades. It used to be that marriages were more about connecting families, securing deals and even state issues (and so it still is in some parts of the world). Nowadays in Western society, marriages tend to be more about two people and their decision. But we're not 100% in the latter model yet, there's lot of social and legal baggage around the older ways. Divorces are not illegal, but they're still socially stigmatized. The point is, we have to deal with how things are actually now, and not only with how they may/should be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "92765   This is great! Thanks for sharing. I can recommend a small change to get most out of docker caching and reducing docker build times to the maximum extent. In the \"builder\" you only need package.json and package-lock.json files to install dependencies. The rest of the sources can be copied in the \"scratch-node\" image. This would make caching work till the last line where only code changes are included. Code is modified much more frequently than dependencies. You sample can look like this: FROM node as builder WORKDIR /app COPY package.json package-lock.json index.js ./ RUN npm install --prod FROM astefanutti/scratch-node COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules /node_modules COPY ./ ./ ENTRYPOINT [\"./node\", \"index.js\"]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "125090  There is an enormous amount of work to do on warships (in my experience); the following doesn't apply everywhere always, but all of it applies sometimes and some of it applies all the time. If you're in engineering, kit is constantly breaking and it is never all working; you'll never catch up, so it's just a question of what you decide to leave broken right now and what you need to fix. The things that are working need constant attention to make sure they stay working; you'll never get them all checked, so there's always something that definitely needs checking really quite soon. In warfare branch(es), as in all branches, the manning situation is never right; there are always gapped billets, requiring other people who don't quite have the right skills and experience having to share that extra workload amongst themselves and to cover extra watches. Going to defence watches or the like (six on, six off, or even four on, four off) is a permanent mindfuck that leaves everyone as a kind of zombie, skating through on routine. The kit is often old, and it's all pretty custom, and so much of it is painfully delicate. This ship doesn't like warm water, that ship has a habit of not being able to power the radar all the time, damn comms constantly up and down. With relatively new classes of ship, every one of the first dozen is basically an experiment, so the new kit refuses to work properly with each other, or maybe just plain at all, and the original purpose the ship was designed for is long gone and what was a cold water submarine hunter meant to last a week on its own before being back in port is now a warm water patrol vessel out for months at a time, constantly stressing systems that were meant to have a steady supply of cold water cooling and were never meant to be active for weeks at a time. Every ship and crew will habitually be asked to do more, with less. Harmony time vanishes, billets get gapped, refits get put off, maintenance cycles become less frequent. It stops when ships basically cease to function.

       "108048  I feel I have that product, but cannot reveal what it is yet, because I have to add it on to my site, which isn't public.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "110086  How about this 2.days.from_last_update? What does it do? What is going on with \"from_last_update\"? Is it actually reaching out to a database to find the last updated value? Which database? How do you configure it? All these questions and more are why you should question \"english as a DSL\" methods. Granted, there's a ton of great libraries out there which do this well. Take Unfiltered's handling of parsing out requests for pattern matching:     case POST(Path(Seg(\"api\" :: \"calls\" :: name :: Nil))) =>\\n  \\nthis is \"englishy\" without having you scratch your head. I've also seen     case POST(Path(\"/api/auth\")) & Authenticate(user) =>\\n  \\nwhich then causes a DB access to happen in a configured implicit value. Now try to reason out why something is not hitting a URL or being denied when you first get into a project.

       "297247  The idea that nuclear waste needs to be isolated for (pick your arbitrarily large number) of years is a misconception based on the assumption that everything else remains static. It won't.  In particular, we are in the middle (actually, maybe still near the beginning) of a biotechnology revolution every bit as profound as the electronic one that started with the transistor. What we fear most from radiation is cancer.  If it weren't for cancer, nuclear power would be a no-brainer.  Its environmental impact is negligible compared to fossil fuels because the volume of fuel mined and transported is so much less.  This was shown in a book titled \"The Health Risks of Not Going Nuclear\", now sadly out of print. And in fact, radiation is a very weak carcinogen.  Frank Von Hippel, a Princeton professor who is no friend of nuclear power, has estimated the total cancer deaths resulting from Fukushima at somewhere near a thousand -- pretty bad for an industrial accident, but hardly the Black Death all over again. Consider cancer treatment today compared to, say, Ben Franklin's time.  Now imagine how much more detailed our understanding of cancer treatment, possibly even prevention, will become in another century or two. If cancer becomes the kind of non-issue that smallpox is today, a disease which used to kill one child in three before the age of 5 in many parts of the world, our descendants will regard us with the same pitying disbelief that we apply to the self-flagellators of 1348 trying to propitiate an angry G*d.

       "196306  For the same reason \"mass surveillance\" is different than \"targeted surveillance\". The US government is performing \"air strikes\"  orders of magnitude  more often than  actual  jet-based air strikes, to the point where it now kills people based on surveillance algorithms rather than a proper investigation of the target. It's going to be yet orders of magnitude  worse  when autonomous drones arrive (they are probably already in testing now) - and make no mistake, autonomous drones is an idea about as irresistible to the government as mass surveillance. Moore's Law will make autonomous drones too hard to resist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "21384   I would have named it \"Hook.io - write clouds of programs using Node.JS\". It's a small yet powerful framework for making your programs discuss together damn easily, nearly the same way you have done it in one program using event emitters, but distributed across programs. It's very easy to hack your first own Hook, to make something something smart by creating an express app for managing what you do, then sending the work to background independent hooks and get some magical stuff happen damn easily. After a proof of concept we just have drop 150 work days (~ middle of the project) of Java/Apache Camel/Spring/OSGI to go Node.JS/Hook.io despite it was not perfect (and despite we had a lot less tooling for NodeJS than Java), because it was able to do the same thing, and even more, in a far easier way, in a more understandable way, and in a more flexible way. We also kept the deadline, and after 60 more work days, we can tell we will be ok for the deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "65075   > for example, the Italian government’s property and assets cannot by law by encumbered in such a manner Well, depending on the country the LTSE is based in, and whether that law is honored through some trade agreement signed into law in that country, I imagine what the Italian government thinks about the issue is moot. > what of situations in which collateral shares are foreclosed upon, they are inherited, or other non-voluntary transfers of ownership? I'm wondering if they have or are considering a grace period where if the shares are reacquired within that period the voting rights remain the same.  I imagine they definitely wouldn't want the rights transferred in the case of foreclosure. Inheritance is an interesting one, but then again, it's only a problem if you take the view that your assets should all be transferred to your relatives on death.  As with inheritance taxes, there are competing incentives.  Maybe shares under a certain quantity could transfer over with voting weight intact, or maybe they should just lose half their time-based voting weight (or just have the time halved, which might still leave them in the top tier of voting weight). There's lots of ways to structure it to achieve certain goals.  I'm sure some would see new case law made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

But the truck does need to burn 20x the energy to go up hills so the system efficiency is going to reflect the weight difference. We can decompose the friction into two categories - air friction and mechanical friction. The mechanical friction should scale linearly with the weight, air friction is the larger term at freeway speeds so maybe trucks aren't  that bad  but they're not going to make an electric truck that can carry a profitable amount of cargo with the current technology. Scale the numbers accordingly, but there's a max weight of 80k lbs. Every ounce of battery cuts into the payload that pays for the truck. Battery technology just isn't there for heavy transportation - it'll get there and I hope it gets there soon but in the mean time, we should have a conversation about using fossil fuels better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "305334  Just signed up and downloaded the Android app.  I saw this in your EULA:  When buying or selling bitcoin, you are buying or selling from Coinbase directly. Coinbase does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin.  What's the effective exchange rate for customers?  You already say you take 1% of each transaction; is the exchange rate tied to the current trading price of one of the major exchanges, or are you setting that yourself (like retailers do for foreign currency)? I imagine you're doing some of your own arbitrage, here.  That's fine as long as prices keep going up.  What happens if prices crash and a bunch of people put in buy orders?  I assume this is where the 48hr window you give yourself to \"retrieve offline funds\" comes in.  In that event, what price do your customers pay?  The market rate when they put in the buy order, or the rate 48 hrs later when you deliver the bitcoins? It's an intriguing and exciting service, but I fear you're either leaving yourself open to massive liability, or are going to be forced to screw over your customers in the event of rapid swings in the value of BtC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "244302  Indeed. Tell any ex-NeXT person circa 1996 that MS would be effectively building their own OPENSTEP for Windows and no one would have believed you. Will be interesting see how they implemented it and whether they used Apportable's Foundation (which looks really well written).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Apple doesn't make those anymore. It makes machines with parts glued together, and drives soldered to the board, whose GPUs overheat and die after a few months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "67839   Like early OneDrive and Windows 8, I really hope a couple people got fired over this debacle. But like today's OneDrive, Windows 10 and .NET Core, I'm glad it's finally moving forward. I know HN has an anti-Microsoft bias from pg on down, but this is serious, proven tech that's moving in the right direction.

I still keep debating whether it's going to be a good experience to deal with holding two screens at once, that along with what the hardware price might be at that point (1k+ for a tablet? Hey, tablet PC's sell for that much already) Hopefully a vendor will pair this transreflective screen for a more natural drawing experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "41098   Seriously. Is it so hard to maintain a document that outlines the steps needed to get a standard OSX or Ubuntu install to the point where you can hack on an app? I have to do in my personal projects often enough that I maintain such a document purely for my own reference, because I forget steps even for my own projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "289179  That makes a little more sense, but I still do not think that anyone would ever mistake Apple's \"I look like an apple\" logo for the Chinese company's \"I don't look like anything but I have a leaf\" logo.

       "102590  > mine can't quite reliably get holes  A great trick for small holes on a FDM printer is to not print them circular but square or triangular. You'd be surprised how small you can get fairly accurate holes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "227624  I wonder if Soylent would have been even more successful if instead of trying to \"develop\" a food from scratch with software engineer skills, they had instead simply rebadged or varied an existing NutriSlim-type product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "286128  Religion is borne out of not knowing what on Earth is the right thing to do, and hence having to  adopt  a certain approach instead of being  convinced  by the merits of one over the others: it's policymaking in the absence of facts.  Do something for long enough and it becomes a part of who you are (your so-called \"worldview\"), at which point an attack on the thing is actually an attack on the ego, and we'll naturally and automatically defend it with the same dirty emotional bullshit trickery we use to gloss over all our insecurities. The toxicity of this is not limited to front-end development, of course -- this is, in fact, the very framework we base modern democracy on.  It's just lots of completely unqualified people (myself included) making a great deal of noise based on shitty information, then - once it inevitably goes tits up - we get together and point the finger at some scapegoat to absolve ourselves of liability. We like to think that as a society we've developed from the primitive peoples of yore, but really all that's happened is that communication tech and industrialism has allowed us to mass produce and saturate our world with the achievements of a very, very select few and thereby create the illusion of universal progress.  This entirely baseless pretence is giving unjust confidence to the (figuratively) blind, who are now leading us into a society of completely misguided moral absolutes: one in which local government officials will parent your kids for you with legislation, physicists will be lynchmobbed for the wrong choice of shirt, and Github will outlaw the use of the word 'meritocracy' for fear of intimidating the weak. So yes, these issues are very important, but HTML and CSS hate games are the least of our worries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "30518   When I tried on an Ivy Bridge laptop-class processor a few years back, move over XMM utilizing a handful of registers was still significantly faster than rep mov. It would make sense for Intel to improve it, though. But my point was more that you need to know what it does to know what you compare. That the \"fast way\" changes over time makes it even more important.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "138186  The problem is that when an idea is in the embryonic stage it's often difficult to pin the central elements down that may be protectable. As you allude to, when you have something tangible like code then you are in a much stronger position. It may not be too late for your ideas, but by the same token you may not actually have anything to protect. On a wider point, much depends on what your new employer will think of the fact you are working on side-projects that may compete with its own ideas. Regardless of who came up with the idea first, they may not want a new hire to be working on similar projects when their energy could be directed at the company's own similar project. Of course they may be perfectly happy for you to continue but it's of course vital you properly map out that work done on your own time will not belong to the company. In this regard, as the other poster says, you would be well-advised to speak with a local lawyer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "216158  Amazon rebooted lots of PV guests. Presumably they collocate HVM and PV guests on the same box. If there were any HVM guests on the box, then there could be the possibility of an attack. (I guess they could forcibly kick off the HVM guests, but that wouldn't be very nice.) Why shouldn't Netflix be running on HVM?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "299545  I'm working on extending this ([1]) to contravariant functors while making the whole thing polytypic and typesafe (so I can abstract over type products and coproducts, among other things).  My stuff will be open-sourced next year sometime at the latest.  I think it's a combination of feature interactions and frequent refactoring during development that is a source for a lot of stuff that is not nice to the compiler. edit:  The extension to [1] is actually pretty benign and the compiler does well with it.  The part that puts a big load on the compiler is that it is used as an interpreter for a popular, yet complicated, visualization DSL.  The compiler, especially the typechecker, has to do a huge amount of work.

       "168313  Please work on reading comprehension.  You'd only be able to try 15 of them.  That gives you a 0.15% chance of guessing.  That's far bigger than 15/(2^128), but I wasn't proposing an optimized system. From the standpoint of industrial espionage operation, a 0.15% chance of success is pretty dismal.  This is only good for the standpoint of protecting a particular device.  If there is a secret that absolutely must be protected on every single device, I think that the company's security has much bigger problems than iPhone PINs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "59701   Google+ is better than Facebook for lots of reasons except for one important thing - nobody's on it and they're still using Facebook. I would much prefer to use Google+, I prefer the interface, I like the Circles idea - everything sort of feels cleaner. But I can't convince any of my non-geek friends to join. They just don't see the point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "295208  How are these guys still in business? It's out of this world. It's also out of this world how this company can't figure out left from right - they haven't released a single product since the failure that was the \"new\" Blackberry Bold 9900 - which was a miserable device that crashed 5x a day. And now they're not releasing anything until 2013. Makes you wonder if they're just buying time in the form of bullshit product roadmaps in the hope of an acquisition. It should not take this long to release a new device, a new OS or whatever the hell they are doing over there. It's a shame, BIS and BBM are two great services, but their OS is just such dated trash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "193302  I think you may have missed the joke here. A pyramid scheme is an unsustainable business model where the gains accrue at the top. The fact the author built it in racket (a racket being another dishonest scheme) makes it all the funnier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "291056  > Saying that humans should not need to work is like saying: This is it. We're done here. This is the world we want. That's not what's being said. We're not done.  This is not the world we want.  We should be able to work on Alzheimer's, clean energy and climate change without worrying about where our next meal is coming from. And, sure, many researches have salaries.  But many potential researchers aren't employed, aren't trained, aren't educated.  Think of the millions of folks whose passion for helping people, taking care of the planet or tinkering is getting sidelined while they work a cash register to save up for community college.  Those people can use a basic income to find a better, more productive, more fulfilling and more useful position in life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "35401   > The basics of linking two pieces of code together aren't terribly complicated The basics aren't complicated, but doing it correctly requires more than the basics IME. Each platform does it slightly differently, and I support multiple platforms.  I've repeatedly seen static libs linked into multiple dynamic libs and cause all kinds of trouble because there's multiple copies of global data, of which only one was probably initialized correctly.  I have seen multiple  different  stdlibs successfully linked into the same program, causing ABI mismatches that compiled, linked, and \"usually\" ran at runtime - but had some nasty crashes to be debugged, because std::vector  was an entirely different type at the call site vs the callee's implementation.  Version mismatches of other SDKs are also common.  I've had all kinds of weird constraints on what compilation and link flags I could use based on what static libs I've linked (e.g. being unable to link with exception handling enabled because one of my dependencies was built with it disabled) Additionally you don't have libs for all my platforms (or sometimes any of them), so I have to build from source anyways, so I have to write build rules for your lib because the defaults probably don't work, and because build rules are never documented I have to mostly reverse engineer intent to do so - possibly without a viable build in the first place if your only working libs are for platforms I don't use. Or if I'm lucky enough that reusing your build rules  is  viable, I have to try and sync various flags between my projects written in one build system and your projects written in yet another build system, and prevent these from getting out of sync for the remainder of the lifetime of the project.  I likely have to jump through all kinds of stupid hoops like installing the exact right version of python and installing undocumented but required packages just to run the configuration scripts that drive the build. ...or for single-source libs, I can probably just drop a single file into one of my existing projects and have everything work.  Okay, so some of that was just because they actually cared about minimizing how painful it is to integrate their library at all, but having a single .c file helped too. I'd only  write  a single .c library for the simplest of libraries - or as an automatically generated file - but it can help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "12646   So I'm starting to think sleep is important. I've lost track of the hours and I think Bill gates sent some fucking goons to fuck with me. Pussy bitch ass cocksucker. Pig shit stained bitch. Whatever I hit his whore of a wife up whenever Billy's out back playing with that little cocktail weiner of his. One time his kid caught us so I pimp slapped his ass down and told him i'd tear his mom a new asshole if he didn't sit there and watch. Fucking perv. he's got some weird incestuous shit going on now for that whore he calls a mom. Fuck I feel great. I've been up for 3 fucking days straight now programming and coming up with real philosophical shit. The best shit I've already shared with you all but man I got a fucking stack more. Freedom sure is fucking awesome isn't it. Well you all have me to thank for that. Freedom didn't exist until I fucking invented it in the 70's. Me and fucking Dennis Ritchie came up with that shit while we were tripping hard on mescaline at Berkeley. Man that was some good shit. Can't find fucking mescaline around anywhere these days. Thanks Nixon and Regan you fucking cunts and your war on drugs. Dennis Ritchies a fucking pimp. He fucking wrote C. I mean come the fuck on lets see you bitches do that. Me and Dennis used to tear shit up hard back in the Berkeley. Dudes a fucking maniac. I watched the crazy bastard fuck a couple of Portuguese Siamese twins while he designed C's arrays. Man's a fucking legend. So back to that whole freedom shit. Feels nice don't it. All that free shit you use every day because of me. Well that's thanks to probably the most important piece of writing ever fucking created. The GPL. The gpl is why you get to play with all this free shit that's as good as the corporate shit the big boys use. don't buy into this bsd license shit or that fucking boost abomination. These are just the jew version of freedom. Do all the fucking work for us so we can leech off it and sell it back to you. Seriously if that's not the definition of some jew shit I dunno what is. Man for a bunch of fat neckbearded little faggots who use free shit I made for you. You sure do like to fucking bitch a lot. If you think systemd is bad you're free to write your own fucking init script or maybe go and suckle on ole billy boy's teats either way get it through your fucking thick retard heads. I made systemd therefore its fucking awesome. Its fucking free dipshits I literally made that shit and gave it to you ungrateful fucks. Clearly debian and anyone with a fucking brain sees this that's why its the fucking new default fucking init. Because it's fucking awesome. Don't like it...make your own...or hook me the fuck up and ill make you whatever the fuck you want. Fucking Tyrone's late and my fucking skin's starting to itch. Fucking bitch as billy's goons better not have fucked with T. Fuuuuuuck man...... Hooooooollllllyyyyy shhiiiiiit. Damn that's some good shit. Holy fuck. Wow I forgot about this shit how long ago did I start this? Fuck after T got here things just became a blur for a while. Pretty sure the bitch is dead fuck it man I'm not going down for that shit. Fuck it. It was the fucking n I g g ers. I'm fucking Jesus Jesus doesn't go fucking down. Not my fault the bitch stopped breathing I mean fuck what kinda hooker can't take cock for 15 minutes straight down her throat. Not a very good one. Useless bitch. Jesus Out. Richard rules.

In order for it to be a fork, something has to get forked from the parent ... like the source code, or the standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "10789   Two words. Fuck you. Fuck your sanctimonious fatalism. Okay, maybe a few more than two words. The day I turned twelve, we found my father dead on the kitchen floor. He'd had a cerebral aneurism in the night, before going to bed. No warning signs, he was in fine shape. I sank into a deep, deep depression for about twenty years; I feel like I lost a vast chunk of time to that. I did very little beyond going through the motions of life and not quite being gloomy enough to kill myself. It may be different if you know the end is coming. I don't know. But I would much rather have had a father as I tried to make sense of who I'd be during my teen and early adult years than this so-called \"gift\".

       "217053  Hi, thanks for your comments. You can type help to see a list of commands that are support. To answer your question about cd, mv, nano, etc I made this in the few hours I had yesterday afternoon, so I'm afraid I only had time to implement a small subset of commands. I've now put it up on GitHub (  ). I hope people can use it as a starting point to build their own web based console applications.

       "309980  I am not a regular cyclist but I think we really should go a bit easier on the bicyclists. When you see a cyclist commuting to work, that means there's one less car on the road. Also add to the fact that cycling is a lot of fun, so I can understand you want to go fast and jump around a bit. As far as stop signs are concerned, let's be more focused on asking the cyclists to stay safe and maybe talk to one of them if they seemed to be endangering their own lives. Remember these are  soft  targets, and sometimes it's actually safer to ride more aggressively than too passively. I know this since I am a motorcyclist, so it's fairly similar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "159311  Being in Tampa, FL is definitely a limiting factor in my desire to continue working professionally with Rails.  However, I really do not want to relocate at this time.  I guess I've been lurking on HN too long, because the availability of .NET jobs and lack of ROR jobs in my area was still surprising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Once I got in the habit of writing tests of even the most simple transformations, the code complexity and my test complexity grew at the same rate, so it's much harder to end up with a giant untestable mass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

But there is still lots of value in connecting with people on a more physical level, and these types of services tap into that value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "76958   It seems much more secure than fingerprints, since that was defeated much more quickly (within a couple days?), with easily lifted prints and a more cost effective (though still somewhat lengthy) method. This, in comparison, seems much harder and consequently further reduces the realistic attack scenarios where people have to be worried. For most people this is a non-issue. (It mostly already was a non-issue with fingerprints, for the same reasons.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "249997  >it's a big deal if a bunch of academics are spending time working on the wrong things At the risk of sounding a little prickly with my comment - isn't it a little presumptuous to write off a certain amount of research as \"wrong\"? There are plenty of examples of research that didn't have a clear purpose leading to breakthroughs - safety glass, microwave ovens, and Teflon all spring to mind. Also, focusing on efficiency doesn't really align with academia's purpose, which (to my mind) has more to do with fundamental research.

It's interesting that we seem to naturally assume that the business reaction would be congruent with what might be the reaction at the human level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "115997  I bike twelve miles a day in Austin (from UT area to Ben White, and back in the afternoon, going along Congress most of the way). 30-40 minutes. Currently I'm borrowing my friend's motorcycle, and when I ride that instead, it's more like 15-20 minutes, taking I-35. Judging by traffic on the other side of the highway, I'm guess it's because I'm commuting the opposite direction of most people. If you have parking, and traffic isn't terrible where/when you're going, the bicycle is usually slower. But, on the other hand, riding a bicycle is so much more _fun_ than driving a car. Riding a motorcycle can also be fun, but still always doesn't beat a bicycle for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "15495   I found that the best way to permanently learn a new language/framework in depth is to build a project.  All the books, articles, and tutorials you read will soon be forgotten if the knowledge learned from them are not practiced in real work.  Sometimes those side projects can become useful, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

The difference is that in a program written in statically typed language you'd have to write fewer unit tests than you would were you to use a dynamically typed language, as in the former much of that testing is going to be automatically done for you by the compiler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "159860  Sadly this seems to be the same old pile-on that happens after every apple product announcement: > #1. No Escape and function keys [...] The Escape and Function keys on the laptops have been abandoned in favor of a touch bar that changed depending on the application that is being used. They went out of their way to display the escape key and many other contextual keys with Terminal.app in the foreground† They did this despite it being possibly the least \"sexy\" demonstration of the hardware. This article seems to have been written after skimming some reporting on the keynote without researching the specifics. †                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "206774  Federated does mean that the network overall does not rely on a specific node. There is no true Mastodon instance, mastodon.social is merely the biggest. I run my own mastodon instance and can federate just fine. Federation is distributed to some extend. However, unlike pure p2p where everyone has a node, it's more like little towns and cities where people live together voluntarily. Each one is a different size, each has it's own rules and if people don't like the rules, they can leave and go elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "47835   For what it's worth, I do think it's more readable, but it's just not a good idea.  It's too easy for people to inject variables into their strings and get your code to print out data that's in memory. map, reduce, filter, etc will be easy to code up once there are generics.  There will almost certainly be generics in Go at some point, that point is just not right now (and almost certainly not before 2.0).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "271144  \"Decentralized\" is always an anti-feature in products like these. It always ends up as a lot of cost for little user benefit.

       "273202   The odd thing is that Windows 8 minimum disk requirements are only 20 GB  ( spitting coffee across room )  Only  20GB!?

       "90183   > 99.9% of which suck goats though. The past decade has seen immense improvements, though. JodaTime is pretty neat and JSR-310 seems to be an improvement on that (haven't used it though). > And then, there's the problem of correctly syncing time display with internal representation [..]  leap second is provided with 6 months of advance, DST/GST changes may be provided with far less (to say nothing of timezone changes). Since the time zone issue is the larger one anyway, this provides a solid (copyright trolling aside) framework for distributing this information: a database distributed and maintained as part of the OS. > Well this is a human time mapping [..] contextual mappings I agree, but it's the context that's hard. You need some way for your abstraction to capture the fact that a \"minute\" can sometime consist of 61 seconds. Consider an application that monitors the number of foos per minute where the developer perfectly reasonable uses the \"minute\" abstraction. This might then exhibit faulty behaviour when there's a leap second inserted - suddenly there's 1/60th more foos reported in a minute. Depending on the application, that might be statistically insignificant and can safely be ignored, or it might be a red flag that triggers someones pager to go off (or worse).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "57079   That's the place to start; the Behemoth trilogy isn't bad, per se, but it is a ramshackle thing by comparison, and I think only partly because it has a larger story to tell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

If you read that economic growth as not being responsible for funding of higher education, you are similarly incorrect. At the national level it\\'s about having strong soft power and at the personal level about it\\'s about \"keeping up with the Joneses\" re: income. \"Higher education, especially in the liberal arts, is for training students to become good community members, citizens and leaders.\" It was my impression that high schools and parents were the mechanism for indoctrinating youths into community values.

And there is a lot more to solving those problems than promoting \"innovation\" or \"economic growth\".\" What are these \"hard problems\"? Hunger? Disease? Working boring jobs to shuffle little bits of paper around? I\\'d wager that the root of your \"hard problems\" is ultimately scarcity in one form or another, and the only way to address that is through technology, and the only way to get that is through STEM training. \"We subsidize higher education because producing citizens with those skills is valuable to our society.\" You echo your given quote here--you instead handwave the \"skills\" involved whereas the quote specifically suggests that economic growth is the valuable criterion to pick skills with. \"Are liberal arts programs perfect? No. Do they cost too much? Maybe. Would it be good for society to have more people going into STEM fields? Probably. Does all this mean that liberal arts education is \"oversold\"? Certainly not.\" I agree, disagree, agree, and disagree again. Liberal arts programs seem to consist primarily of a great deal of reading and research, augmented with the professional musings of an elder in the field. Is my impression incorrect? If it is not, is there a particular reason why it costs so much when that material is so cheaply available?

I wish my GP would do the same. I recently had a really high cholesterol reading (both total cholesterol and LDL). Everything else (blood pressure, blood glucose etc) seems fine. I\\'m 38, fit and healthy and nothing that suspect in my family history. I found the attitude of my doctor in all this quite surprising. It amounted basically to \"You definitely have familial hypercholesterolemia. There is no other possible option here other than statins\". No further questions about what I eat, my stress levels, lifestyle - nothing. What disappoints me the most here is now that I feel like it\\'s all on me to determine what my real risk levels are and what\\'s appropriate to treat this. I don\\'t subscribe to the mainstream NHS view still heavily pushed that eating saturated fat -> high cholesterol == unhealthy as I think it\\'s a lot more complicated (as this article shows).

What I don\\'t get is why, if you\\'re the NSA, would you go through the PR effort for people already on \"your side\"; you\\'re not going to sway a large swath of the population and there surely can\\'t be that many fence sitters on this issue.', 'comment_id': 6913199, 'parent_id': 6913115}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

The European Commission's ruling was strongly influenced by the fact that Android devices represent the majority of the market and that the Android OS is really the only choice for device manufacturers.

A casual glance at the predicament faced by lower income people in the United States, compared to more redistributionist OECD nations, suggests that redistribution (particularly universal healthcare funded by higher income taxes) can significantly improve living standards for those worse off. The first result I found when searching for 'income inequality vs growth', a summary of 2011 and 2014 IMF studies in the Economist [1], suggests that while redistribution may impede growth, inequality itself is associated with lower growth per person and therefore redistribution which actually reduces inequality is beneficial. It's hard to say that there is 'overwhelming' evidence that increased redistribution slows wage growth for those with the lowest income.

If academic publishers attract too much attention with a lawsuit, and more people understand their revenue model, I doubt that the public would be on their side. So maybe this encourages them to be more cautious. In fact, Sci-Hub is not a real threat to academic publishers as long as universities do not cancel their subscriptions because of it. Of course, many universities probably won't want to tell their researchers to just use Sci-Hub (because of legal concerns, and because it could disappear the next day). So leaving Sci-Hub mostly alone may well be a deliberate decision from academic publishers.\", 'comment_id': 15034467, 'parent_id': 15034434}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

If we didn't need to work, what reason would there to learn to read? If we were rewarded with land, shelter, food and comfort for doing nothing, what would the incentive for those who will inevitably be responsible for keeping everything together? Plants don't grow without care and attention, electricity isn't as simple as sticking two wires into a powerpoint or setting up solar panels, if nobody worked, nobody would study and if nobody studied there would be no people left in the world. Money, sad to say motivates people, it motivates the disadvantaged to strive for more, it motivates the rogue developer with a wife and kids to attempt to build the next big thing knowing the reward will be a comfortable life where the family doesn't need to worry about money. Perhaps there is a better way, removing class barriers, maybe there is no such thing as lower class, you are either middle or upper class. A system where even a school janitor has an opportunity to do something more and earn a decent living.

Protip: if you have a shitty registration name, have it change, that\\'s easy and that\\'s for you own good.', 'comment_id': 6145674, 'parent_id': 6142898}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

All parties agree the law (§ 103 StGB, to insult a foreign head of state) is outdated and needs to go. Removing it won\\'t be fast-tracked, at the same time the case again the comedian Mr Böhmermann will surely be slow-tracked by the investigators. Chancellor Merkel, after pressure from Turkey, followed the law though she had the right to overturn it (§ 104a StGB). Anyway, once removed a judge in Germany can check what the law said when the case was opened vs the current state of the law and use the milder one (§ 2 StGB). I expect the comedian will be fine.

Focus on yourself, toughen up and learn to accept rejection and just meet as many women as you can.  That is the only path to success.

Many of the great people you look up to aren\\'t smarter than you, many of them didn\\'t go to the right college. They just worked hard, and worked smart, for long enough. What you\\'re doing here is identifying an external excuse to psychologically allow yourself to fail. I apologise if this seems harsh, but it\\'s true. It also comes across as really, really whiny. The only option you\\'ve got is just to get on with it. Stop worrying about being a master, or being great - just concentrate on being better than you were yesterday.

Joel Spolsky covered this fairly well in his piece on McDonald\\'s-style software. The best way to write a single program is to master programming, and develop alone or in a small group of masters, and build a beautiful and enduring tool with whatever practices suit you best. But none of that can be packaged up and passed around to new programmers on demand. It takes time to master, and it certainly can\\'t be smoothly overseen by someone who never learned it. The best way to get 100,000 programmers writing a billion lines of code is to develop simple routines that can be followed and overseen by anyone. The results won\\'t be as good as mastery, but in many cases they don\\'t need to be. There\\'s a lot of simple software out there which benefits more from being done now than being done right. Having said all that, I do think rigidity is becoming a problem for the software industry. It\\'s not being employed at the levels needed to make software  work , it\\'s being employed at the levels needed to make development  legible . Adding procedures that worsen development but make it easier to watch is a serious issue.

May even avoid the need for the diesel car bans being mooted in my city (and some other German cities).\", 'comment_id': 17108592, 'parent_id': 17107538}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Computing polygons is basically applying one function to an array of values and is delegated to the GPU, so its no wonder they easily reach 60 FPS with hundred of thousands of polygons per frame. A better comparison would be against the performance of game logic, which in a game engine can easily become the bottleneck from all the conditionals, random memory accesses and sequential dependencies. And even there they don't sit on nearly as many layers of abstractions as a web page does. This comes at the cost of productivity; building a web site is a few orders of magnitude more productive than using the latest game engines. Of course, sitting on the DOM and its many quirks as well as its reflow/redraw cycles can make it harder to reach 60FPS in the browser.

Being short is bloody expensive, the upside isn't that big (unless you're long some underpriced insurance) and everyone is basically against you, for ages. If shorting/going long had the same upside/downside you'd have a much saner world. But that ain't the world we live in, and guys who want to go short, like me, just go into straight cash and treasuries (because strong governments have guns/monopoly on taxes) to wait it out until prices to return to sane levels. This leads to a curious selection bias where only the craziest are present in the market (the rabid masses I like to call them) and they bid up everything to insane levels, while the sane just sit it out. This leads to bubbles of much greater variance than if those who currently wait out bubbles could reasonably bet against global stupidity. Instead, I'm sitting on tons of cash while equity is overvalued throughout the world, and blowhards are plowing their life savings into computational fiat (think about it). We do live in quite the world, don't we?

I guess that this would be the next-best thing after FHE?. The catch is the performance, right? I mean, the paper says: \"In order to make the database end-to-end encrypted yet still capable of performing queries, the client encrypts the\\nbuckets (at the time of creation or modification). The server, which stores the buckets, never knows the encryption\\nkey used. The objects referenced by the leaf nodes of the B-Tree indexes are also encrypted client-side. As a result,\\nthe server doesn’t know how individual objects are organized within the B-Tree or whether they belong to an index\\nat all. Since ZeroDB is encryption agnostic, probabilistic encryption can ensure that the server cannot even compare\\nobjects for equality.\\n When a client performs a query, it asks the server to return buckets of the tree as it traverses the index remotely\\nand incrementally , as in Fig. 2b. The client fetches and decrypts buckets in order to figure out which buckets in the\\nnext level of the tree to fetch next. Frequently accessed buckets can be cached client-side so that subsequent queries\\ndo not make unnecessary network calls.\" Which would suggest that it might be a bit slow to do many round-trips for each query. I\\'m guessing there could be some specific use-cases where this is not so relevant?

Companies want to outsource because they want to keep more money themselves.  Executive salaries have risen practically exponentially.  Why is it that only the workers have to suck in their belt?  If we should be happy living on $50k/yr then what the ever loving fuck do they need with MILLIONS per year? If companies want to try and outsource then let them.  They've tried and yet we're still all employed.  Why?  Because the market has spoken.  This is what it costs to develop, full stop.  People getting paid less than this are just an arbitrage situation in the company's favor. It has nothing to do with entitlement, it has to do with those who have some understanding of how the market works and those who are utterly ignorant of it.\", 'comment_id': 2441923, 'parent_id': 2439693}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Not sure what you mean here. People have been using OS X to make music professionaly, including in huge $10.000/day studios, for a decade, with Pro Tools, Logic and Cubase. They also use it live, in 90% of electronic music lives you\\'ll see one or more Mac laptops. Now, while a few plugins or some hosts might crash (they\\'re software after all, and quality varies) now and then, with something like Reason that you mention there are hardly ANY crashes ever. And, since I\\'ve also used Windows for music for a long time (Cubase mostly) and my brother still uses it full-time as a pro, it\\'s not like things are any more stable there. But still, stable enough to get thousands of professionals using Windows/PT/Cubase/etc too. And don\\'t get me started on the BS idea that Linux based DAWs are \"more stable\" because of \"Linux = rock solid\" etc stuff. Linux DAWs are few, with few commiters, lacking in UI refinements, and more importantly lacking in basic functionality. They are also a pain to setup (unless you want to work with just simple audio and some of their native plugins, and no MIDI, VST etc), and crash all the time. Been there, done that. Now, of course a M1 or a modern synth will be \"always there\" and more stable that an computer plugin, but stuff like: >* I\\'m not risking my ability to make music on the incredibly widespread incompetence of programmers, even at the best companies on earth* puzzles me. It\\'s not like the potential for instability of this \"widespread incompetence of programmers\" prevented all professional artists currently employed to produce records with DAWs and plugins.', 'comment_id': 9538350, 'parent_id': 9536536}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

From the source: \"VW continued to assert to CARB and the EPA that the increased emissions from these vehicles could be attributed to various technical issues and unexpected in-use conditions.  VW issued a voluntary recall in December 2014 to address the issue.  CARB, in coordination with the EPA, conducted follow up testing of these vehicles [...] to confirm the efficacy of the recall.

I lost  17 kg on the paleo diet( net loss, as I have gained a fair amount of muscle following gymnastic bodies WODs), but it's sometimes difficult to follow when you are traveling a lot, as I do. You don't realize how the vast majority of food you find on bars, cafeteria and restaurants is based on wheat or sugar till you try to avoid them! Since january i am following a semipaleo Lean gains diet( semi paleo in the sense that I mostly avoid grains and sugar, but drink some milk or have some pasta or a cookie every now and then). I had regained some 4 kgs before chrismas due to really poor diet( only 3 months that I didn't take care of the diet and ...bam!). Now I've managed to lose 2 kgs and improved strenght(only cardio is 15 min once or twice a week as active recovery).\\nDefinetely experiencing a nice body recomposition...\\n Lets see if I can get to 10% body fat this way...( now I am more on the 20% :/\", 'comment_id': 3554629, 'parent_id': 3554483}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

The ideas can\\'t flow when you are constantly held up by not having mastered an underlying skill.  I almost love this analogy. There\\'s certainly an aspect of \"menial mathematics\" which is like typing in that it directly translates into fluency of thought. There\\'s also an aspect of discovery, though, that\\'s missing from the metaphor. There is a large difference between inferring that some equality holds based on abstract principles and actually performing the evaluation and directly tracing out why that equality holds (even very non-generally). I liken it to statistical modeling sometimes: models allow you to talk about and comprehend data on a high level, but only by directly plotting all of the data at high resolution can you let your brain\\'s natural pattern seeking tendencies reach out for further insight. That\\'s a common theme there: granularity versus generality.', 'comment_id': 2603560, 'parent_id': 2603373}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

As lovers of the bullet-proof Rust vest and creative coding frameworks like OpenFrameworks and Processing we felt it was about time to merge the benefits of the two while attempting to apply some of the lessons learned by these predecessors. While the library is certainly still in its youth we have been using it with great success in our recent commercial work and feel it is finally time to share it with fellow hackers and artists who might like to have a play or perhaps even join the project! I'll be around to answer any questions for the next hour or two and then will try to make it back on tomorrow before we give the presentation at Protopixel in Barcelona. I'd like to apologise in advance for the lack of HTTPS - the site is still fresh and we are in the process of getting it working ASAP. If you would like to skip the announcement post and jump straight to the git repo see here[1]. If you are more curious about the API and would like to jump to the Rust reference, see here[2].

There always is a deeper meaning in the sense that we can analyze what the characters represent in a political, social or other context. We can also analyze the author through similar lenses. But rarely is there a code hiding just below the surface. Unfortunately, that didn\\'t stop me from incessantly searching for them, even to the detriment of my education.

Another way to look at it is that Pixar knows stories of redemption are compelling. They use that arc as artfully as they use color or big eyes on their characters.

For one, the \"respect your values\" arguments goes both ways: she values a diamond, he doesn\\'t. If she insists on a diamond, she\\'s not respecting his values. If he insists on no diamond, he\\'s not respecting hers. It\\'s very easy to  justify  going the no-diamond route, sure. From a financial point of view, it\\'s just a bad idea. Some say the finances aren\\'t the point, so you can turn to ethical arguments (diamonds are bloody business). You can\\'t really  lose  the no-diamond argument; it\\'s too easy to make. Still, it\\'s awfully convenient for the  guy  to be the one making the argument against buying an expensive ring. This doesn\\'t make the arguments  wrong , but depending on the relationship, the girl might suspect that the guy is  making  those arguments, not out of financial responsibility or morality, but out of apathy or simply being cheap. The guy might be making sound arguments, but his ulterior motive might still be problematic, and the girl might be taking issue with that. Also, there is a whole lot of meaning (artificial, but real just the same) that goes into the rituals of marriage, and you can\\'t just dismiss all of that with some textbook argument about diamond cartels. The relationship isn\\'t doomed in this case; the couple can grow past it, and it\\'s an opportunity to understand each other. The problem is, if either the guy or the girl takes on the perspective of \"I\\'m obviously right and you\\'re wrong if you disagree,\" then they\\'re being unreasonable and stalling out the relationship.  Both  parties need to be honest and understand the other to get past it. The discussion over the diamonds may in fact be very important because it gets to the heart of a bunch of concurrent issues.  (I\\'m using \"guy\" and \"girl\" here because that\\'s the situation where these cultural norms are at play. Obviously any other combination of genders could have the same issues, though I suspect it\\'s less common in those cases.)

Thanks for sharing. I can recommend a small change to get most out of docker caching and reducing docker build times to the maximum extent. In the \"builder\" you only need package.json and package-lock.json files to install dependencies. The rest of the sources can be copied in the \"scratch-node\" image. This would make caching work till the last line where only code changes are included. Code is modified much more frequently than dependencies.

If you're in engineering, kit is constantly breaking and it is never all working; you'll never catch up, so it's just a question of what you decide to leave broken right now and what you need to fix. The things that are working need constant attention to make sure they stay working; you'll never get them all checked, so there's always something that definitely needs checking really quite soon. In warfare branch(es), as in all branches, the manning situation is never right; there are always gapped billets, requiring other people who don't quite have the right skills and experience having to share that extra workload amongst themselves and to cover extra watches. Going to defence watches or the like (six on, six off, or even four on, four off) is a permanent mindfuck that leaves everyone as a kind of zombie, skating through on routine. The kit is often old, and it's all pretty custom, and so much of it is painfully delicate. This ship doesn't like warm water, that ship has a habit of not being able to power the radar all the time, damn comms constantly up and down. With relatively new classes of ship, every one of the first dozen is basically an experiment, so the new kit refuses to work properly with each other, or maybe just plain at all, and the original purpose the ship was designed for is long gone and what was a cold water submarine hunter meant to last a week on its own before being back in port is now a warm water patrol vessel out for months at a time, constantly stressing systems that were meant to have a steady supply of cold water cooling and were never meant to be active for weeks at a time. Every ship and crew will habitually be asked to do more, with less. Harmony time vanishes, billets get gapped, refits get put off, maintenance cycles become less frequent. It stops when ships basically cease to function.

It won\\'t.  In particular, we are in the middle (actually, maybe still near the beginning) of a biotechnology revolution every bit as profound as the electronic one that started with the transistor. What we fear most from radiation is cancer.  If it weren\\'t for cancer, nuclear power would be a no-brainer.  Its environmental impact is negligible compared to fossil fuels because the volume of fuel mined and transported is so much less.  This was shown in a book titled \"The Health Risks of Not Going Nuclear\", now sadly out of print. And in fact, radiation is a very weak carcinogen.  Frank Von Hippel, a Princeton professor who is no friend of nuclear power, has estimated the total cancer deaths resulting from Fukushima at somewhere near a thousand -- pretty bad for an industrial accident, but hardly the Black Death all over again. Consider cancer treatment today compared to, say, Ben Franklin\\'s time.  Now imagine how much more detailed our understanding of cancer treatment, possibly even prevention, will become in another century or two. If cancer becomes the kind of non-issue that smallpox is today, a disease which used to kill one child in three before the age of 5 in many parts of the world, our descendants will regard us with the same pitying disbelief that we apply to the self-flagellators of 1348 trying to propitiate an angry G*d.

I'm wondering if they have or are considering a grace period where if the shares are reacquired within that period the voting rights remain the same.  I imagine they definitely wouldn't want the rights transferred in the case of foreclosure. Inheritance is an interesting one, but then again, it's only a problem if you take the view that your assets should all be transferred to your relatives on death.  As with inheritance taxes, there are competing incentives.  Maybe shares under a certain quantity could transfer over with voting weight intact, or maybe they should just lose half their time-based voting weight (or just have the time halved, which might still leave them in the top tier of voting weight). There's lots of ways to structure it to achieve certain goals.  I'm sure some would see new case law made.\", 'comment_id': 16037757, 'parent_id': 16037643}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Maybe the truck doesn't burn energy 20x as fast going down the road, but if we compare the fuel efficiency of cars to semi trucks, it's apparent that trucks burn at least 5x as much fuel as passenger cars. But the truck does need to burn 20x the energy to go up hills so the system efficiency is going to reflect the weight difference. We can decompose the friction into two categories - air friction and mechanical friction. The mechanical friction should scale linearly with the weight, air friction is the larger term at freeway speeds so maybe trucks aren't  that bad  but they're not going to make an electric truck that can carry a profitable amount of cargo with the current technology. Scale the numbers accordingly, but there's a max weight of 80k lbs. Every ounce of battery cuts into the payload that pays for the truck. Battery technology just isn't there for heavy transportation - it'll get there and I hope it gets there soon but in the mean time, we should have a conversation about using fossil fuels better.\", 'comment_id': 15716870, 'parent_id': 15716728}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Coinbase does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin.  What\\'s the effective exchange rate for customers?  You already say you take 1% of each transaction; is the exchange rate tied to the current trading price of one of the major exchanges, or are you setting that yourself (like retailers do for foreign currency)? I imagine you\\'re doing some of your own arbitrage, here.  That\\'s fine as long as prices keep going up.  What happens if prices crash and a bunch of people put in buy orders?  I assume this is where the 48hr window you give yourself to \"retrieve offline funds\" comes in.  In that event, what price do your customers pay?  The market rate when they put in the buy order, or the rate 48 hrs later when you deliver the bitcoins?

It\\'s just lots of completely unqualified people (myself included) making a great deal of noise based on shitty information, then - once it inevitably goes tits up - we get together and point the finger at some scapegoat to absolve ourselves of liability. We like to think that as a society we\\'ve developed from the primitive peoples of yore, but really all that\\'s happened is that communication tech and industrialism has allowed us to mass produce and saturate our world with the achievements of a very, very select few and thereby create the illusion of universal progress.  This entirely baseless pretence is giving unjust confidence to the (figuratively) blind, who are now leading us into a society of completely misguided moral absolutes: one in which local government officials will parent your kids for you with legislation, physicists will be lynchmobbed for the wrong choice of shirt, and Github will outlaw the use of the word \\'meritocracy\\' for fear of intimidating the weak.

As you allude to, when you have something tangible like code then you are in a much stronger position. It may not be too late for your ideas, but by the same token you may not actually have anything to protect. On a wider point, much depends on what your new employer will think of the fact you are working on side-projects that may compete with its own ideas. Regardless of who came up with the idea first, they may not want a new hire to be working on similar projects when their energy could be directed at the company's own similar project. Of course they may be perfectly happy for you to continue but it's of course vital you properly map out that work done on your own time will not belong to the company.

Why shouldn't Netflix be running on HVM?\", 'comment_id': 8404423, 'parent_id': 8404412}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

You'd only be able to try 15 of them.  That gives you a 0.15% chance of guessing.  That's far bigger than 15/(2^128), but I wasn't proposing an optimized system. From the standpoint of industrial espionage operation, a 0.15% chance of success is pretty dismal.  This is only good for the standpoint of protecting a particular device.  If there is a secret that absolutely must be protected on every single device, I think that the company's security has much bigger problems than iPhone PINs.\", 'comment_id': 1384807, 'parent_id': 1384727}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

We should be able to work on Alzheimer's, clean energy and climate change without worrying about where our next meal is coming from. And, sure, many researches have salaries.  But many potential researchers aren't employed, aren't trained, aren't educated.  Think of the millions of folks whose passion for helping people, taking care of the planet or tinkering is getting sidelined while they work a cash register to save up for community college.  Those people can use a basic income to find a better, more productive, more fulfilling and more useful position in life.\", 'comment_id': 11839002, 'parent_id': 11838943}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Each platform does it slightly differently, and I support multiple platforms.  I\\'ve repeatedly seen static libs linked into multiple dynamic libs and cause all kinds of trouble because there\\'s multiple copies of global data, of which only one was probably initialized correctly.  I have seen multiple  different  stdlibs successfully linked into the same program, causing ABI mismatches that compiled, linked, and \"usually\" ran at runtime - but had some nasty crashes to be debugged, because std::vector  was an entirely different type at the call site vs the callee\\'s implementation.  Version mismatches of other SDKs are also common.  I\\'ve had all kinds of weird constraints on what compilation and link flags I could use based on what static libs I\\'ve linked (e.g. being unable to link with exception handling enabled because one of my dependencies was built with it disabled) Additionally you don\\'t have libs for all my platforms (or sometimes any of them), so I have to build from source anyways, so I have to write build rules for your lib because the defaults probably don\\'t work, and because build rules are never documented I have to mostly reverse engineer intent to do so - possibly without a viable build in the first place if your only working libs are for platforms I don\\'t use. Or if I\\'m lucky enough that reusing your build rules  is  viable, I have to try and sync various flags between my projects written in one build system and your projects written in yet another build system, and prevent these from getting out of sync for the remainder of the lifetime of the project.  I likely have to jump through all kinds of stupid hoops like installing the exact right version of python and installing undocumented but required packages just to run the configuration scripts that drive the build. ...or for single-source libs, I can probably just drop a single file into one of my existing projects and have everything work.  Okay, so some of that was just because they actually cared about minimizing how painful it is to integrate their library at all, but having a single .c file helped too.

I've lost track of the hours and I think Bill gates sent some fucking goons to fuck with me. Pussy bitch ass cocksucker. Pig shit stained bitch. Whatever I hit his whore of a wife up whenever Billy's out back playing with that little cocktail weiner of his. One time his kid caught us so I pimp slapped his ass down and told him i'd tear his mom a new asshole if he didn't sit there and watch. Fucking perv. he's got some weird incestuous shit going on now for that whore he calls a mom. Fuck I feel great. I've been up for 3 fucking days straight now programming and coming up with real philosophical shit. The best shit I've already shared with you all but man I got a fucking stack more. Freedom sure is fucking awesome isn't it. Well you all have me to thank for that. Freedom didn't exist until I fucking invented it in the 70's. Me and fucking Dennis Ritchie came up with that shit while we were tripping hard on mescaline at Berkeley. Man that was some good shit. Can't find fucking mescaline around anywhere these days. Thanks Nixon and Regan you fucking cunts and your war on drugs. Dennis Ritchies a fucking pimp. He fucking wrote C. I mean come the fuck on lets see you bitches do that. Me and Dennis used to tear shit up hard back in the Berkeley. Dudes a fucking maniac. I watched the crazy bastard fuck a couple of Portuguese Siamese twins while he designed C's arrays. Man's a fucking legend. So back to that whole freedom shit. Feels nice don't it. All that free shit you use every day because of me. Well that's thanks to probably the most important piece of writing ever fucking created. The GPL. The gpl is why you get to play with all this free shit that's as good as the corporate shit the big boys use. don't buy into this bsd license shit or that fucking boost abomination. These are just the jew version of freedom. Do all the fucking work for us so we can leech off it and sell it back to you. Seriously if that's not the definition of some jew shit I dunno what is. Man for a bunch of fat neckbearded little faggots who use free shit I made for you. You sure do like to fucking bitch a lot. If you think systemd is bad you're free to write your own fucking init script or maybe go and suckle on ole billy boy's teats either way get it through your fucking thick retard heads. I made systemd therefore its fucking awesome. Its fucking free dipshits I literally made that shit and gave it to you ungrateful fucks. Clearly debian and anyone with a fucking brain sees this that's why its the fucking new default fucking init. Because it's fucking awesome. Don't like it...make your own...or hook me the fuck up and ill make you whatever the fuck you want. Fucking Tyrone's late and my fucking skin's starting to itch. Fucking bitch as billy's goons better not have fucked with T. Fuuuuuuck man...... Hooooooollllllyyyyy shhiiiiiit. Damn that's some good shit. Holy fuck. Wow I forgot about this shit how long ago did I start this? Fuck after T got here things just became a blur for a while. Pretty sure the bitch is dead fuck it man I'm not going down for that shit. Fuck it. It was the fucking n I g g ers. I'm fucking Jesus Jesus doesn't go fucking down. Not my fault the bitch stopped breathing I mean fuck what kinda hooker can't take cock for 15 minutes straight down her throat. Not a very good one. Useless bitch. Jesus Out. Richard rules.

Fuck you. Fuck your sanctimonious fatalism. Okay, maybe a few more than two words. The day I turned twelve, we found my father dead on the kitchen floor.

You can type help to see a list of commands that are support. To answer your question about cd, mv, nano, etc I made this in the few hours I had yesterday afternoon, so I'm afraid I only had time to implement a small subset of commands. I've now put it up on GitHub (  ). I hope people can use it as a starting point to build their own web based console applications.

When you see a cyclist commuting to work, that means there's one less car on the road. Also add to the fact that cycling is a lot of fun, so I can understand you want to go fast and jump around a bit. As far as stop signs are concerned, let's be more focused on asking the cyclists to stay safe and maybe talk to one of them if they seemed to be endangering their own lives. Remember these are  soft  targets, and sometimes it's actually safer to ride more aggressively than too passively.

That\\'s the rub.  It\\'s gone way beyond that.

Each one is a different size, each has it's own rules and if people don't like the rules, they can leave and go elsewhere.\", 'comment_id': 17625424, 'parent_id': 17625392}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

You need some way for your abstraction to capture the fact that a \"minute\" can sometime consist of 61 seconds. Consider an application that monitors the number of foos per minute where the developer perfectly reasonable uses the \"minute\" abstraction. This might then exhibit faulty behaviour when there\\'s a leap second inserted - suddenly there\\'s 1/60th more foos reported in a minute.
